//playwright code can be written here
//Step 1 - open browser
// having the 'await' keyword after every step to ensure steps are properly complete before the next step is executed 
//also 'async' function is requried for await to function accordingly
//Step 2 - enter U/P (takes 2 seconds)
//Step 3 - click
// JS is asychronus meaning no gaurentee it will be executed step by step but rather will be executed at the same time
